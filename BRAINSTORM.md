# Brainstorm

This is a book about what to keep from other Indians.

## What makes this book good?
- It secretly verbalizes what Indians are thinking and it is in written form
- It is very matter of fact and not so formal about the message
- And it does not feel like I am talking to a retard.
  - Based on the concepts and the wording.

## Plan
- I will write and share it with people in every language for free other than in English and Hindi.
- Words like these spoken in the native tongue is important to change the narrative of the country for those languages

## Thinking Fodder
- It is wrong to imagine my life and then think about how to keep things from Indians
  - How can this be an act of courage if this is not translated to every single indian language?

## Draft Brainstorm
- This is a book about what to keep from other Indians.
- A major source of clarity
- An important first read
  - I want to express to people in this book that as much as you want others to not peer into your own particular thing that you want to hide

### Why keep things from other Indians? Why build a world of one?
- India is a country that simultaneously lives in different times

- A great way to build a beautiful world is by respecting others' privacy.
- If you are sexually of a different make up

### Things to keep private
- Who you like, fancy
  - There is no upside and only downsides
- Salary
  - Two strategies
    - Don't ask don't tell
    - Tell as well as ask

### Advice about sex and dating
- Here is the truth:
  - Everyone sucks
  - Everyone is bad at it
  - There is no good version

### Solution to having someone to say things to

## Thoughts
- I was imagining it as a colorful book. Something that makes a good commentary on indian society.
- This is a therapeutic effort
  - Because i can clearly think through what I want and then we can
- We are building a following of people who are true believers and not fakers
